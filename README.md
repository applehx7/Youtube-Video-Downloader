# Youtube-Video-Downloader
A simple Python application that allows users to download YouTube videos through a graphical user interface (GUI). Built with Tkinter for the UI and Pytube for downloading videos, this project offers an easy-to-use solution for saving YouTube videos locally. The app also uses Pillow for handling images within the interface.
